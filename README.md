# Aim 
Aim of the project was to create the Snake Game in which the user can use the keys ‘A’,’S’,’D’ and ‘W’ to control the snake and make it eat the fruit which keeps on appearing randomly anywhere on the screen. The code was written in Dev C++ and used fundamental concepts of C++ like Functions, Classes and Loops.
